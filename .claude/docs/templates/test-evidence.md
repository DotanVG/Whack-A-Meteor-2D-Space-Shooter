## What Was Tested

[One paragraph describing the feature or behaviour that was validated. Include
the acceptance criteria numbers from the story that this evidence covers.]

**Acceptance criteria covered**: [AC-1, AC-2, AC-3]

## Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion (from story) | Result | Notes |
|---|----------------------|--------|-------|
| AC-1 | [exact criterion text] | PASS / FAIL | [any observations] |
| AC-2 | [exact criterion text] | PASS / FAIL | |
| AC-3 | [exact criterion text] | PASS / FAIL | |

| # | Filename | What It Shows | Acceptance Criterion |
|---|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| 1 | `[filename.png]` | [brief description of what is visible] | AC-1 |
| 2 | `[filename.png]` | | AC-2 |

*If video: note the timestamp and what it demonstrates.*

## Test Conditions

- **Game state at start**: [e.g., "fresh save, player at level 1, no items"]
- **Platform / hardware**: [e.g., "Windows 11, GTX 1080, 1080p"]
- **Framerate during test**: [e.g., "stable 60fps" or "~45fps — within budget"]
- **Any special setup required**: [e.g., "dev menu used to trigger specific state"]

---

## Observations

[Anything noteworthy that didn't cause a FAIL but should be recorded. Examples:
minor visual jitter, frame dip under load, behaviour that technically passes
but felt slightly off. These become candidates for polish work.]

- [Observation 1]
- [Observation 2]

If nothing notable: *No significant observations.*

## Sign-Off

All three sign-offs are required before the story can be marked COMPLETE via
`/story-done`. Visual/Feel stories require the designer or art-lead sign-off.
UI stories require the UX lead or designer sign-off.

| Role | Name | Date | Signature |
|------|------|------|-----------|
| Developer (implemented) | | | [ ] Approved |
| Designer / Art Lead / UX Lead | | | [ ] Approved |
| QA Lead | | | [ ] Approved |

**Any sign-off can be marked "Deferred — [reason]"** if the person is
unavailable. Deferred sign-offs must be resolved before the story advances
past the sprint review.
