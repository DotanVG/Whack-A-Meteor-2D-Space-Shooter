# HUD Design: [Game Name]

> **Status**: Draft | In Review | Approved | Implemented
> **Author**: [Name or agent — e.g., ui-designer]
> **Last Updated**: [Date]
> **Game**: [Game name — this is a single document per game, not per element]
> **Platform Targets**: [All platforms this HUD must work on — e.g., PC, PS5, Xbox Series X, Steam Deck]
> **Related GDDs**: [Every system that exposes information through the HUD — e.g., `design/gdd/combat.md`, `design/gdd/progression.md`, `design/gdd/quests.md`]
> **Accessibility Tier**: Basic | Standard | Comprehensive | Exemplary
> **Style Reference**: [Link to art bible HUD section if it exists — e.g., `design/gdd/art-bible.md § HUD Visual Language`]

> **Note — Scope boundary**: This document specifies all elements that overlay the
> game world during active gameplay — health bars, ammo counters, minimaps, quest
> trackers, subtitles, damage numbers, and notification toasts. For menu screens,
> pause menus, inventory, and dialogs that the player navigates explicitly, use
> `ux-spec.md` instead. The test: if it appears while the player is directly
> controlling their character, it belongs here.

## 1. HUD Philosophy

> **Why this section exists**: The HUD design philosophy is not decoration — it is a
> design constraint that every subsequent decision is measured against. Without a
> philosophy, individual elements get added on request ("the quest tracker wants a
> bigger icon") without any principled way to push back. With a philosophy, there is
> a shared, explicit standard. More importantly, the philosophy prevents the HUD from
> slowly growing to cover the game world while each individual addition seemed
> reasonable in isolation. Write this before specifying any elements.

**What is this game's relationship with on-screen information?**

[One paragraph. This is a design statement, not a description of features. Consider
the game's genre, pacing, and player fantasy. A stealth game's HUD philosophy might
be: "The world is the interface. If the player has to look away from the environment
to survive, the HUD has failed." A tactics game might say: "Complete situational
awareness is the game. The HUD is not an overlay — it is the battlefield."

Reference comparable games if helpful, but describe your specific stance:
Example — diegetic-first action RPG: "We treat screen information as a concession,
not a feature. Every HUD element must earn its pixel space by answering the question:
would the player make demonstrably worse decisions without this information visible?
If the answer is 'they'd adapt,' we put it in the environment instead."]

**Visibility principle** — when in doubt, show or hide?

[State the default resolution for ambiguous cases. Options:
- Default to HIDE: information is available on demand (e.g., Dark Souls — no quest tracker, no minimap, stats are in a menu)
- Default to SHOW: players prefer to be informed; cluttered is better than uncertain
- Default to CONTEXTUAL: information appears when it becomes relevant and fades when it does not
Most games benefit from contextual defaults. State your game's default clearly so every element decision is consistent.]

**The Rule of Necessity for this game**:

[Complete this sentence: "A HUD element earns its place when ______________."

Example: "...the player would have to stop playing to find the same information
elsewhere, or would make meaningfully worse decisions without it."

Example: "...removing it in playtesting causes measurable frustration or confusion
in more than 25% of testers within the first hour of play."

This rule is the veto power over feature requests to add HUD elements. Document it
so it can be cited in design reviews.]

## 2. Information Architecture

> **Why this section exists**: Before specifying any HUD element's visual design,
> position, or behavior, you must answer a more fundamental question: should this
> information be on the HUD at all? This section is a forcing function — it requires
> you to categorize EVERY piece of information the game world generates and make an
> explicit, intentional decision about how each is presented. "We'll figure that out
> later" is how games end up with 18 elements competing for the player's peripheral
> vision. This table is the master inventory of game information, not just HUD information.

| Information Type | Always Show | Contextual (show when relevant) | On Demand (menu/button) | Hidden (environmental / diegetic) | Reasoning |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------|
| [Health / Vitality] | [X if action game — player needs constant awareness] | [X if exploration game — show only when injured] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: always visible because health decisions (retreat, heal) must be instant in combat] |
| [Primary resource (mana / stamina / ammo)] | [ ] | [X — show when resource is being consumed or is critically low] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: contextual because stable resource levels are not decision-relevant] |
| [Secondary resource (currency / materials)] | [ ] | [ ] | [X — check in inventory] | [ ] | [Example: on-demand because resource totals don't affect immediate gameplay decisions] |
| [Minimap / Compass] | [X] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: always visible because navigation decisions are constant during exploration] |
| [Quest objective] | [ ] | [X — show when objective changes or player is near it] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: contextual — player knows their objective; only remind at key moments] |
| [Enemy health bar] | [ ] | [X — show only during combat encounters] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: contextual because enemy health is irrelevant outside combat] |
| [Status effects (buffs/debuffs)] | [ ] | [X — show when active] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: contextual because status effects only affect decisions when present] |
| [Dialogue subtitles] | [X when dialogue is playing] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: always show while dialogue is active — accessibility requirement] |
| [Combo / streak counter] | [ ] | [X — show while combo is active, hide on reset] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: contextual because it communicates active performance, not baseline state] |
| [Timer] | [ ] | [X — show only in timed sequences] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: contextual because timers only exist in specific encounter types] |
| [Tutorial prompts] | [ ] | [X — show for first-time situations only] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: contextual and one-time; never repeat to experienced players] |
| [Score / points] | [ ] | [X — show in score-relevant modes only] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: contextual by game mode; hidden in modes where score is irrelevant] |
| [XP / level progress] | [ ] | [ ] | [X — available via character screen] | [ ] | [Example: on-demand because progression does not affect in-moment gameplay decisions] |
| [Waypoint / objective marker] | [ ] | [X — show when player is navigating to objective] | [ ] | [ ] | [Example: contextual — suppress during cutscenes, cinematic moments, and free exploration] |

## 3. Layout Zones

> **Why this section exists**: The game world is the primary content — the HUD is a
> frame around it. Before placing any element, divide the screen into named zones
> with explicit positions and safe zone margins. This section prevents two failure
> modes: (1) elements placed ad-hoc until the screen is cluttered, and (2) elements
> that overlap platform-required safe zones and get rejected in certification.
> Every element in Section 4 must be assigned to a zone defined here.

### 3.1 Zone Diagram

```

> Rule for zone placement: the center 40% of the screen (both horizontally and
> vertically) is the player's primary focus area. Keep this zone as clear as
> possible at all times. HUD elements that appear in the center zone — crosshairs,
> interaction prompts, hit markers — must be minimal, high-contrast, and brief.

### 3.2 Zone Specification Table

| Zone Name | Screen Position | Safe Zone Compliant | Primary Elements | Max Simultaneous Elements | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|-------|
| [Top Left] | [Top-left corner, within safe margin] | [Yes — 10% from top, 10% from left] | [Health bar, stamina bar, shield bar] | [3] | [Vital status — player's own resources. Priority zone for player state.] |
| [Top Center] | [Top edge, centered horizontally] | [Yes — 10% from top] | [Quest objective, area name (on enter)] | [1 — only one message at a time] | [Use for narrative context, not mechanical information. Keep text minimal.] |
| [Top Right] | [Top-right corner, within safe margin] | [Yes — 10% from top, 10% from right] | [Ammo count, ability cooldowns] | [2] | [Weapon/ability state. Most relevant during active combat.] |
| [Center] | [Screen center ±15%] | [N/A — not a margin zone] | [Crosshair, interaction prompt, hit marker] | [1 active at a time] | [CRITICAL: Nothing persistent here. Only momentary indicators.] |
| [Bottom Left] | [Bottom-left corner, within safe margin] | [Yes — 10% from bottom, 10% from left] | [Minimap, ability icons] | [2] | [Navigation and ability readout. Small, non-intrusive.] |
| [Bottom Center] | [Bottom edge, centered horizontally] | [Yes — 10% from bottom] | [Subtitles, tutorial prompts] | [2 — subtitle + tutorial may coexist] | [Highest-priority accessibility zone. Never place other elements here.] |
| [Bottom Right] | [Bottom-right corner, within safe margin] | [Yes — 10% from bottom, 10% from right] | [Notification toasts, pick-up feedback] | [3 stacked] | [Transient notifications. Stack vertically. Oldest disappears first.] |

**Safe zone margins by platform**:

| Platform | Top | Bottom | Left | Right | Notes |
|----------|-----|--------|------|-------|-------|
| [PC — windowed] | [0% — no safe zone required] | [0%] | [0%] | [0%] | [But respect minimum resolution — elements must not crowd at 1280x720] |
| [PC — fullscreen] | [3%] | [3%] | [3%] | [3%] | [Slight margin for 4K TV-connected PCs] |
| [Console — TV] | [10%] | [10%] | [10%] | [10%] | [Action-safe zone for broadcast-spec TVs. Some TVs overscan beyond this.] |
| [Steam Deck] | [5%] | [5%] | [5%] | [5%] | [Small screen; safe zone is smaller but crowding risk is higher] |
| [Mobile — portrait] | [15% top] | [10% bottom] | [5%] | [5%] | [15% top avoids notch/camera cutout on most devices] |
| [Mobile — landscape] | [5%] | [5%] | [15% left] | [15% right] | [Thumb placement on landscape — side zones are obscured by hands] |

## 4. HUD Element Specifications

> **Why this section exists**: Each HUD element needs its own specification to be
> built correctly. Ad-hoc implementation of HUD elements produces inconsistent
> sizing, mismatched update frequencies, missing urgency states, and accessibility
> failures. This section is the implementation brief for every element — fill it
> completely before any element moves into development.

### 4.1 Element Overview Table

> One row per HUD element. This is the master inventory for implementation planning.

| Element Name | Zone | Always Visible | Visibility Trigger | Data Source | Update Frequency | Max Size (% screen W) | Min Readable Size | Overlap Priority | Accessibility Alt |
|-------------|------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| [Health Bar] | [Top Left] | [Yes] | [N/A] | [PlayerStats] | [On value change] | [20%] | [120px wide] | [1 — highest] | [Numerical text label showing current/max: "80/100"] |
| [Stamina Bar] | [Top Left] | [No — context] | [Show when consuming stamina; hide 3s after full] | [PlayerStats] | [Realtime during use] | [15%] | [80px wide] | [2] | [Numerical label, or hide if full (accessible assumption)] |
| [Shield Indicator] | [Top Left] | [No — context] | [Show when shield is active or recently hit] | [PlayerStats] | [On value change] | [20%] | [120px wide] | [3] | [Numerical label. Must not use color alone — add shield icon.] |
| [Ammo Counter] | [Top Right] | [No — context] | [Show when weapon is equipped; hide when unarmed] | [WeaponSystem] | [On fire / on reload] | [10%] | ["88/888" readable at game's min resolution] | [4] | [Text-only fallback: "32 / 120"] |
| [Minimap] | [Bottom Left] | [Yes] | [N/A — but suppressed in cinematic mode] | [NavigationSystem] | [Realtime] | [18%] | [150x150px] | [5] | [Cardinal direction compass strip as fallback; must be toggleable] |
| [Quest Objective] | [Top Center] | [No — context] | [Show on objective change; show when near objective location; hide after 5s] | [QuestSystem] | [On event] | [30%] | [Legible at body text size] | [6] | [Read aloud on objective change via screen reader] |
| [Crosshair] | [Center] | [No — context] | [Show when ranged weapon equipped; hide in melee or unarmed] | [WeaponSystem / AimSystem] | [Realtime] | [3%] | [12px diameter minimum] | [1 — center zone priority] | [Reduce motion: static crosshair only. Option to enlarge.] |
| [Interaction Prompt] | [Center] | [No — context] | [Show when player is within interaction range of an interactive object] | [InteractionSystem] | [On enter/exit interaction range] | [15%] | [24px icon + readable text] | [2 — center zone] | [Text description of interaction always present, not icon-only] |
| [Subtitles] | [Bottom Center] | [No — always on when dialogue plays, if setting enabled] | [Show during any voiced line or ambient dialogue] | [DialogueSystem] | [Per dialogue line] | [60%] | [Minimum 24px font] | [1 — highest in zone] | [This IS the accessibility feature — see Section 8 for subtitle spec] |
| [Damage Numbers] | [World-space / anchored to entity] | [No — context] | [Show on any damage event; duration 800ms] | [CombatSystem] | [On event] | [5% per number] | [18px minimum] | [3] | [Option to disable; numbers can overwhelm for photosensitive players] |
| [Status Effect Icons] | [Top Left — below health bar] | [No — context] | [Show when any status effect is active on player] | [StatusSystem] | [On effect add/remove] | [3% per icon] | [24px per icon] | [3] | [Icon + text label on hover/focus. Never icon-only.] |

### 4.2 Element Detail Blocks

> For each element in the table above, write a detail block. Copy and complete
> one block per element.

---

**Health Bar**

- Visual description: [Horizontal fill bar. Left-to-right fill direction. Segmented at 25/50/75% to aid reading at a glance. Background: dark semi-transparent (40% opacity). Fill color: context-dependent — see Urgency States.]
- Data displayed: [Current HP as fill percentage. Numerical value displayed as text below bar at all times: "80 / 100".]
- Update behavior: [Bar fill decreases or increases smoothly using a lerp over 150ms per change. Large damage (>25% single hit) triggers a brief flash (1 frame white, then drain).]
- Urgency states:
  - Normal (>50% HP): [Green fill, no special behavior]
  - Caution (25–50% HP): [Yellow fill, low warning pulse every 4 seconds]
  - Critical (<25% HP): [Red fill, persistent slow pulse (1 Hz), vignette appears at screen edges]
  - Zero (0% HP): [Bar empties and turns grey; death state begins]
- Interaction: [Display only. Not interactive. Player cannot click, hover, or focus this element as an action target.]
- Player customization: [Opacity adjustable (see Section 7 Tuning Knobs). Can be repositioned to any corner by player in accessibility settings.]

---

**Minimap**

- Visual description: [Circular mask, radius = 75px at reference resolution 1920x1080. Player icon at center. North always up unless player has unlocked "Rotate minimap" setting. Range = configurable, default 80 world units radius.]
- Data displayed: [Player position, nearby enemies (if detection perk unlocked), quest markers within range, points of interest icons, traversal obstacles (walls, drops).]
- Update behavior: [Realtime. Updates every frame. Enemy icons fade in/out as they enter/leave detection range over 300ms.]
- Urgency states: [None for the map itself. Enemy icons turn red when they are in combat-alert state.]
- Interaction: [Not interactive in-game. Press dedicated Map button to open the full map screen (separate UX spec).]
- Player customization: [Size: S/M/L (70/90/110px radius). Opacity: 30–100%. Rotation: locked-north or player-relative. Can be disabled entirely (compass strip shows as fallback).]

## 5. HUD States by Gameplay Context

> **Why this section exists**: The HUD is not a static overlay — it is a dynamic
> system that must adapt to what the player is doing. A HUD designed only for
> standard gameplay will look wrong in cutscenes, feel cluttered in exploration,
> and occlude critical information in boss fights. This section defines the
> transformations the HUD undergoes in each gameplay context. It is also the spec
> for the system that manages HUD visibility — the HUD state machine.

| Context | Elements Shown | Elements Hidden | Elements Modified | Transition Into This State |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| [Exploration — no threats] | [Minimap, Quest Objective (faded, 60%), Subtitles (if active)] | [Ammo Counter, Crosshair, Damage Numbers, Status Effects (if none active)] | [Health Bar fades to 40% opacity — visible but not dominant] | [Fade transition, 500ms, when no enemies detected for 10s] |
| [Combat — active threat] | [Health Bar (full opacity), Stamina Bar (when used), Ammo Counter, Crosshair, Damage Numbers, Status Effects, Enemy Health Bars] | [Quest Objective (temporarily hidden), Notification Toasts (paused queue)] | [Minimap scales down 15% and raises opacity to 100%] | [Immediate snap in on first enemy detection — no fade. Combat readiness requires instant info.] |
| [Dialogue / Cutscene] | [Subtitles, Dialogue speaker name] | [All gameplay HUD elements: health, ammo, minimap, crosshair, damage numbers] | [N/A] | [All gameplay elements fade out over 300ms when cutscene flag is set] |
| [Cinematic (scripted camera sequence)] | [Subtitles only] | [Everything else including speaker name] | [Letterbox bars appear (if applicable to this game's style)] | [Immediate on cinematic flag; letterbox slides in from top/bottom over 400ms] |
| [Inventory / Menu open] | [None — inventory renders full-screen or as overlay] | [All HUD elements] | [Game world visible but paused behind inventory screen] | [All HUD elements hide over 150ms as menu opens] |
| [Death / Respawn pending] | [Death screen overlay — separate spec] | [All gameplay HUD elements] | [Screen desaturates and darkens over 800ms] | [Death state begins when HP reaches 0 — HUD elements fade over 600ms] |
| [Loading / Transition] | [Loading indicator, tip text] | [All gameplay HUD elements] | [N/A] | [Instant on level transition trigger] |
| [Tutorial — new mechanic] | [Standard context HUD + Tutorial Prompt overlay] | [Nothing additional hidden] | [Tutorial prompt dims background subtly to draw attention to prompt] | [Tutorial system fires ShowTutorial event; prompt fades in over 200ms] |
| [Boss Encounter] | [Boss health bar appears (large, bottom of screen or top center), all combat elements] | [Quest Objective] | [Boss bar renders in a distinct visual style — must not be confused with player health] | [Boss health bar slides in on boss encounter trigger over 400ms] |

---

## 6. Information Hierarchy

> **Why this section exists**: Not all HUD information is equally important. When
> screen space is limited, when the player is under high stress, or when elements
> compete for the same zone, there must be a principled priority order that governs
> which elements survive and which get suppressed. This section formalizes that
> hierarchy so it can be enforced systematically and not just "feels obvious" decisions
> made at implementation time.

| Element | Priority Tier | Reasoning | What Replaces It If Hidden |
|---------|--------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| [Subtitles] | [MUST KEEP — never hide during dialogue] | [Accessibility requirement. Legal requirement in some markets. Story clarity.] | [N/A — nothing replaces subtitles] |
| [Health Bar] | [MUST KEEP — during any state where the player can be damaged] | [Without health visibility, survival decisions become impossible] | [Auditory cues (heartbeat, breathing) supplement but do not replace] |
| [Crosshair] | [MUST KEEP — while aiming with a ranged weapon] | [Targeting without a crosshair is a precision failure, not a difficulty feature] | [Alternative: dot-only mode for minimalists; never fully hidden while aiming] |
| [Interaction Prompt] | [MUST KEEP — when player is in interaction range] | [Without it, interactive objects are invisible to the player] | [Environmental visual cues can supplement but interaction affordance must be explicit] |
| [Ammo Counter] | [SHOULD KEEP] | [Low ammo decisions (switch weapon, reload) require awareness; can be contextual] | [Auditory "click" on empty chamber is acceptable fallback for experienced players] |
| [Minimap] | [SHOULD KEEP] | [Navigation requires spatial awareness; loss forces repeated map opens] | [Compass strip (simplified directional indicator) is acceptable fallback] |
| [Status Effects] | [SHOULD KEEP — while active] | [Active debuffs change what actions are viable; invisible debuffs feel unfair] | [Character animation states can partially communicate status effects (limping, sparks)] |
| [Quest Objective] | [CAN HIDE] | [Player can hold objective in memory for extended periods; contextual is correct default] | [Player remembers objective from context] |
| [Damage Numbers] | [CAN HIDE] | [Feedback element, not decision-critical. Many players turn these off.] | [Hit sounds and enemy reactions communicate hit registration] |
| [Notification Toasts] | [CAN HIDE in high-intensity moments] | [Mid-combat "You gained 50 XP" is noise, not signal. Queue and show after combat.] | [Queue held and released when combat ends] |
| [Combo Counter] | [ALWAYS HIDE when combo resets or player is not attacking] | [Stale combo information is actively misleading] | [N/A — simply hidden] |

---

## 7. Visual Budget

> **Why this section exists**: Without explicit budget constraints, HUD elements
> accumulate until the game world is nearly invisible. These numbers are hard limits,
> not guidelines. Every element addition that would breach a limit requires explicit
> approval and must displace or reduce an existing element.

| Budget Constraint | Limit | Measurement Method | Current Estimate | Status |
|------------------|-------|--------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Maximum simultaneous active HUD elements | [8] | [Count all visible, non-faded elements at any one frame] | [TBD — verify at implementation] | [To verify] |
| Maximum % of screen occupied by HUD (exploration mode) | [12%] | [Pixel area of all HUD elements / total screen pixels] | [TBD] | [To verify] |
| Maximum % of screen occupied by HUD (combat mode) | [22%] | [Same method — combat adds ammo, crosshair, enemy bars] | [TBD] | [To verify] |
| Maximum % of center screen zone (40% of screen W/H) occupied | [5%] | [Only crosshair and interaction prompt allowed here] | [TBD] | [To verify] |
| Minimum contrast ratio — HUD text on any background | [4.5:1 (WCAG AA)] | [Measured against the darkest and lightest game world areas the element will appear over] | [TBD] | [To verify] |
| Maximum opacity for HUD background panels | [65%] | [Opacity of any panel behind HUD text — must preserve world visibility through panel] | [TBD] | [To verify] |
| Minimum HUD element size at minimum supported resolution | [40px for icons, 18px for text] | [Measure at lowest target resolution] | [TBD] | [To verify] |

> **How to apply these budgets**: For every new HUD element proposed during
> production, require the proposer to state (1) which budget line it affects,
> (2) what the new total will be, and (3) what existing element will be reduced or
> made contextual to stay within budget. "It's a small icon" is not an analysis.

---

## 8. Feedback & Notification Systems

> **Why this section exists**: Notifications are the most frequently-added and
> worst-controlled part of most HUDs. Every system wants to tell the player
> something. Without explicit rules about notification priority, stacking limits,
> and queue behavior, the notification zone becomes a firehose of overlapping
> toasts that players learn to ignore entirely. This section establishes the
> notification contract for all systems.

| Notification Type | Trigger System | Screen Position | Duration (ms) | Animation In / Out | Max Simultaneous | Priority | Queue Behavior | Dismissible? |
|------------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| [Item Pickup] | [InventorySystem] | [Bottom Right — toast] | [2000] | [Slide in from right 200ms / fade out 300ms] | [3 stacked] | [Low] | [FIFO queue; older toasts pushed up as new ones enter] | [No — auto-dismiss] |
| [XP Gain] | [ProgressionSystem] | [Bottom Right — toast, below item toasts] | [1500] | [Fade in 150ms / fade out 300ms] | [1 — XP messages merge: "XP +150"] | [Very Low — suppress during combat, queue for post-combat] | [Combat-aware queue] | [No] |
| [Level Up] | [ProgressionSystem] | [Center screen — persistent until dismissed] | [Persistent — requires input to dismiss] | [Scale up from 80% + fade in 400ms] | [1] | [High — interrupts normal toasts] | [Pauses all other notifications until dismissed] | [Yes — any input] |
| [Quest Update] | [QuestSystem] | [Top Center] | [4000] | [Slide down from top 250ms / fade out 400ms] | [1 — top center is single-message zone] | [Medium] | [If quest update arrives while previous is visible, extend duration by 2000ms; do not stack] | [No] |
| [Objective Complete] | [QuestSystem] | [Top Center] | [3000] | [Same as Quest Update but with additional completion sound] | [1] | [Medium-High — preempts Quest Update] | [Preempts any queued top-center message] | [No] |
| [Critical Warning (low health, hazard)] | [CombatSystem / EnvironmentSystem] | [Screen edge vignette + text at center-bottom] | [Persistent while condition active] | [Fade in 200ms; fades out 500ms when condition clears] | [1 per warning type] | [Critical — never suppressed] | [Renders immediately, bypasses all queues] | [No] |
| [Achievement Unlocked] | [AchievementSystem] | [Bottom Right — distinct from item toasts] | [4000] | [Slide in from right with icon expansion 300ms / fade out 400ms] | [1] | [Low] | [Queues behind item toasts; never more than one achievement toast at a time] | [No] |
| [Hint / Tutorial] | [TutorialSystem] | [Bottom Center] | [Persistent — until player performs the action or dismisses] | [Fade in 300ms] | [1] | [Medium] | [Only one tutorial hint at a time; queue others] | [Yes — B button / Esc] |

**Notification queue rules**:
1. Combat-aware queue: notifications tagged as Low priority are queued, not displayed, when the player is in combat state. The queue is flushed in a batch when the player exits combat, with a max of 3 items displayed in sequence.
2. Merge rule: identical notification types that fire within 500ms of each other are merged into a single notification with a combined value (e.g., "Item Pickup x3" rather than three separate toasts).
3. Critical notifications (health warning, environmental hazard) are never queued, never merged, and always displayed immediately regardless of combat state or existing notifications.

## 9. Platform Adaptation

> **Why this section exists**: A HUD designed at 1920x1080 on a monitor may be

| Platform | Safe Zone | Resolution Range | Input Method | HUD-Specific Notes |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [PC — Windows, 1920x1080 reference] | [3% margin] | [1280x720 min to 3840x2160 max] | [Mouse + keyboard, controller optional] | [HUD must scale correctly at all resolutions. Test at 1280x720 — minimum before cert. Consider ultrawide (21:9) — minimap must not stretch.] |
| [PC — Steam Deck, 1280x800] | [5% margin] | [Fixed 1280x800] | [Controller + touchscreen] | [Smaller screen means minimum text sizes are critical. Test ALL elements at this resolution. Touch targets irrelevant (controller-only by default).] |
| [PlayStation 5 / Xbox Series X] | [10% margin] | [1080p to 4K] | [Controller] | [Console certification requires TV safe zone compliance. Action-safe is 90% of screen area. Test on a real TV, not a monitor — overscan behavior differs.] |
| [Mobile — iOS / Android] | [15% top, 10% other sides] | [360x640 min to 414x896 common] | [Touch] | [Notch/camera cutout avoidance at top. Bottom home indicator zone avoidance. Portrait and landscape layouts may differ significantly — specify both.] |

**HUD repositionability requirement**: Players must be able to reposition at minimum the following elements using an in-game HUD layout editor (required for accessibility compliance on console):
- Health bar
- Minimap
- Ability bar (if present)

Repositioning saves to player profile, not to a single slot. Applies across play sessions.

## 10. Accessibility — HUD Specific

> **Why this section exists**: HUD accessibility failures are the most visible
> accessibility failures in games — players encounter the HUD in every session,
> in every gameplay moment. Color-blind failures, illegible text at minimum scale,
> and inability to disable distracting animations are among the top accessibility
> complaints in game reviews. This section defines HUD-specific requirements; refer
> to the project's `docs/accessibility-requirements.md` for the full project standard.

### 10.1 Colorblind Modes

| Element | Color-Only Information Risk | Colorblind Mode Fix |
|---------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| [Health bar fill] | [Red = low health uses red/green distinction] | [Add icon pulse + vignette as non-color indicators. Red fill is supplemental, not sole indicator.] |
| [Damage numbers] | [Red = taken, green = healed] | [Add minus (-) prefix for damage, plus (+) for healing. Symbols, not color.] |
| [Enemy health bars] | [If colored by faction or threat level] | [Add text label or icon badge for faction/threat level. Never color-only.] |
| [Status effect icons] | [If icon tint communicates status type] | [All status icons must have distinct shapes, not just distinct colors. Shape encodes meaning; color is secondary.] |
| [Minimap icons] | [If player vs. enemy vs. objective distinguished by color] | [Distinct icon shapes: circle = player, triangle = enemy, star = objective. Color supplements shape.] |

### 10.2 Text Scaling

[Describe what happens when the player sets the UI text scale to 150% (the maximum required for your Accessibility Tier). Which elements reflow? Which elements clip? Which elements are architecturally blocked from scaling (e.g., fixed-size canvases)?

Example: "Health bar numerical label grows with text scale — bar expands slightly to accommodate. Quest objective text wraps at 150% scale — verify Top Center zone can accommodate two-line objectives. Damage numbers do not scale (they are world-space, not screen-space) — this is an accepted limitation documented here."]

**Text scaling test matrix**:

| Element | 100% (baseline) | 125% | 150% | Overflow behavior |
|---------|----------------|------|------|-------------------|
| [Health bar label] | [Pass] | [Pass] | [TBD] | [Bar expands; does not overlap stamina bar] |
| [Quest objective text] | [Pass] | [TBD] | [TBD] | [Wraps to second line; zone height expands] |
| [Notification toast text] | [Pass] | [TBD] | [TBD] | [Toast width expands to max 35% screen width, then wraps] |
| [Subtitle text] | [Pass] | [TBD] | [TBD] | [Dedicated subtitle zone — must accommodate scale] |

### 10.3 Motion Sensitivity

| Animation / Motion Element | Severity | Disabled by Reduced Motion Setting? | Replacement Behavior |
|---------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|
| [Health bar low-HP pulse] | [Mild] | [Yes] | [Solid fill, no pulse. Vignette remains as it is less likely to trigger sensitivity.] |
| [Screen edge vignette] | [Moderate] | [Optional — separate toggle] | [Replace with static darkened corners at 30% opacity] |
| [Damage numbers float upward] | [Mild] | [Yes] | [Instant appear/disappear in place, no float] |
| [Notification toast slide-in] | [Mild] | [Yes] | [Instant appear at final position] |
| [Level up center animation] | [High] | [Yes — required] | [Static level up card, no scale animation, no particle effects] |
| [Combo counter scale pulse] | [Mild] | [Yes] | [Number increments without scale animation] |

### 10.4 Subtitles Specification

> Subtitles are the highest-impact accessibility feature in the HUD. Specify them
> with the same rigor as the rest of the HUD. Do not leave subtitle behavior to
> implementation discretion.

- **Default setting**: [ON or OFF — document your game's default and the rationale. Industry standard is ON by default.]
- **Position**: Bottom Center zone, centered horizontally, above the bottom safe zone margin
- **Max characters per line**: [42 characters — the readable limit for subtitle lines at minimum text size on TV viewing distance]
- **Max simultaneous lines**: [2 lines before scrolling — do not display more than 2 lines at once]
- **Speaker identification**: [Speaker name displayed in color or above subtitle text — never rely on color alone; add colon prefix: "ARIA: The door is locked."]
- **Background**: [Semi-transparent black panel, 70% opacity, behind all subtitle text — ensures contrast against any game world background]
- **Font size minimum**: [24px at 1080p reference — scales with text scale setting]
- **Line break behavior**: [Break at natural language pause points — before conjunctions, after commas, never mid-word]
- **Subtitle persistence**: [Each subtitle line holds for the duration of the spoken line plus 300ms after it ends — never disappear while audio is still playing]
- **Non-dialogue captions**: [Document whether ambient sounds, music descriptions, and sound effects are captioned — e.g., "[tense music]", "[explosion in the distance]" — and where these appear if different from dialogue subtitles]

### 10.5 HUD Opacity and Visibility Controls

The following player-adjustable settings must be available from the Accessibility menu:

| Setting | Range | Default | Effect |
|---------|-------|---------|--------|
| [HUD Opacity — Global] | [0% (HUD hidden) to 100%] | [100%] | [Scales all HUD element opacities simultaneously] |
| [HUD Text Scale] | [75% to 150%] | [100%] | [Scales all HUD text elements; layout adapts] |
| [Damage Number Visibility] | [On / Off] | [On] | [Enables or disables all floating damage numbers] |
| [Minimap Visibility] | [On / Off / Compass Only] | [On] | [Compass strip shown as fallback when minimap off] |
| [Notification Verbosity] | [All / Important Only / Off] | [All] | [All = all toasts; Important Only = quest + level up; Off = no toasts] |
| [Motion Reduction] | [On / Off] | [Off] | [When On, replaces all animated HUD transitions with instant state changes] |
| [High Contrast Mode] | [On / Off] | [Off] | [Applies high contrast visual theme to all HUD elements — see art bible for HC variants] |

## 11. Tuning Knobs

> **Why this section exists**: HUD behavior should be data-driven to the same degree
> as gameplay systems. Values that are hardcoded are values that require an engineer
> to change. Values that are in config can be tuned by a designer or adjusted for
> player preferences. Document all tunable parameters before implementation so the
> programmer knows which values to externalize.

| Parameter | Current Value | Range | Effect of Increase | Effect of Decrease | Player Adjustable? | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| [Notification display duration (default)] | [2000ms] | [500ms – 5000ms] | [Toasts persist longer — less likely to be missed, more screen clutter] | [Toasts disappear faster — cleaner, higher miss risk] | [No — but player can adjust verbosity level] | [Per-type overrides in Section 8 take precedence] |
| [Notification queue max size] | [8] | [3 – 15] | [More messages preserved but queue takes longer to clear] | [Older messages dropped earlier] | [No] | [Expand if playtesting reveals important messages being lost] |
| [Health bar low-HP pulse frequency] | [1 Hz] | [0.5 – 2 Hz] | [More urgent feeling — can become fatiguing] | [Calmer — may fail to communicate urgency] | [No — but Reduced Motion disables it] | [Linked to accessibility setting] |
| [Combat HUD reveal duration] | [0ms (instant)] | [0 – 300ms] | [Softer reveal — feels less jarring] | [Instant — highest responsiveness] | [No] | [Keep at 0ms — combat information must be instant] |
| [Exploration HUD fade-out delay] | [10000ms (10s after last threat)] | [3000 – 30000ms] | [HUD fades sooner — cleaner exploration] | [HUD stays longer — more reassurance] | [No] | [Tune based on playtest; 10s is a starting estimate] |
| [Minimap range (world units visible)] | [80] | [40 – 200] | [More map context visible] | [Tighter local view] | [Yes — Small/Medium/Large preset] | [Exposed as S/M/L, not raw unit value] |
| [Minimap size (px radius at 1080p)] | [75] | [50 – 120] | [Larger map, more screen space consumed] | [Smaller, less intrusive] | [Yes — S/M/L preset] | [Three sizes exposed to player] |
| [Damage number duration (ms)] | [800] | [400 – 1500] | [Numbers linger longer — easier to read, more cluttered] | [Numbers clear faster — cleaner, harder to parse] | [No] | [Tune based on visual noise in dense combat] |
| [Global HUD opacity] | [100%] | [0 – 100%] | [Fully visible] | [Fully hidden] | [Yes — opacity slider in Accessibility settings] | [0% = full HUD off; some players prefer this] |

## 13. Open Questions

> Track unresolved design questions here. All questions must be resolved before
> the HUD design document can be marked Approved.

| Question | Owner | Deadline | Resolution |
|----------|-------|----------|-----------|
| [e.g., Should the minimap show enemy positions by default, or only after a detection skill is unlocked?] | [systems-designer + ui-designer] | [Sprint 5, Day 2] | [Pending — depends on progression GDD decision] |
| [e.g., Does the game have a boss health bar, or do bosses use the standard enemy health bar? Bosses need a visually distinct treatment if they are significantly more important than normal enemies.] | [game-designer] | [Sprint 5, Day 1] | [Pending] |
| [e.g., Damage numbers: diegetic (floating in world space, occluded by geometry) or screen space (always readable, overlaid on HUD layer)?] | [ui-designer + lead-programmer] | [Sprint 4, Day 5] | [Pending — architecture decision affects rendering layer choice] |
| [e.g., Mobile portrait vs. landscape: does the game support both orientations? If yes, each requires its own zone layout.] | [producer] | [Sprint 3, Day 3] | [Pending — platform scope decision required first] |
