> **Last Updated**: [Date]
> **Accessibility Tier Target**: [Basic / Standard / Comprehensive / Exemplary]
> **Platform(s)**: [PC / Xbox / PlayStation 5 / Nintendo Switch / iOS / Android]
> **External Standards Targeted**:
> - WCAG 2.1 Level [A / AA / AAA]
> - AbleGamers CVAA Guidelines
> - Xbox Accessibility Guidelines (XAG) [Yes / No / Partial]
> - PlayStation Accessibility (Sony Guidelines) [Yes / No / Partial]

> **Accessibility Consultant**: [Name and organization, or "None engaged"]
> **Linked Documents**: `design/gdd/systems-index.md`, `docs/ux/interaction-pattern-library.md`

> **Why this document exists**: Per-screen accessibility annotations belong in
> UX specs. This document captures the project-wide accessibility commitments,
> the feature matrix across all systems, the test plan, and the audit history.
> It is created once during Technical Setup by the UX designer and producer,
> then updated as features are added and audits are completed. If a feature
> conflicts with a commitment made here, this document wins — change the feature,
> not the commitment, unless the producer approves a formal revision.

## Accessibility Tier Definition

> **Why define tiers**: Accessibility is not binary. Defining four tiers gives
> the team a shared vocabulary, forces an explicit commitment at the start of
> production, and prevents scope creep in both directions ("we'll add it later"
> and "we have to support everything"). The tiers below are this project's
> definitions — the industry uses similar but not identical language. Commit to
> a tier with specific feature targets, not just the tier name.

### Tier Definitions

| Tier | Core Commitment | Typical Effort |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **Basic** | Critical player-facing text is readable at standard resolution. No feature requires color discrimination alone. Volume controls exist for music, SFX, and voice independently. The game is completable without photosensitivity risk. | Low — primarily design constraints |
| **Standard** | All of Basic, plus: full input remapping on all platforms, subtitle support with speaker identification, adjustable text size, at least one colorblind mode, and no timed input that cannot be extended or toggled. | Medium — requires dedicated implementation work |
| **Comprehensive** | All of Standard, plus: screen reader support for menus, mono audio option, difficulty assist modes, HUD element repositioning, reduced motion mode, and visual indicators for all gameplay-critical audio. | High — requires platform API integration and significant UI architecture |
| **Exemplary** | All of Comprehensive, plus: full subtitle customization (font, size, color, background, position), high contrast mode, cognitive load assist tools, tactile/haptic alternatives for all audio-only cues, and external third-party accessibility audit. | Very High — requires dedicated accessibility budget and specialist consultation |

### This Project's Commitment

**Target Tier**: [Standard]

**Rationale**: [Write 3-5 sentences justifying the tier choice. Do not simply
state the tier — explain the reasoning. Consider: What is the game's genre and
how does it map to common accessibility barriers (e.g., fast-twitch games have
motor barriers; reading-heavy games have visual barriers)? Who is the target
player and what does the research say about disability prevalence in that group?
What are the platform requirements (Xbox requires XAG compliance for ID@Xbox)?
What is the team's capacity? What would dropping one tier cost the player base,
in concrete terms?

Example: "This is a narrative RPG with turn-based combat targeted at players
25-45. The turn-based structure eliminates the most severe motor barriers common
in action games, but the reading-heavy design creates significant visual and
cognitive barriers. Standard tier addresses all of these. Exemplary tier is not
achievable without a dedicated accessibility engineer. Xbox ID@Xbox program
requires XAG compliance for Game Pass consideration, which Standard meets.
Dropping to Basic would exclude players who rely on colorblind modes or input
remapping, estimated at 8-12% of the target audience based on AbleGamers data."]

**Features explicitly in scope (beyond tier baseline)**:
- [e.g., "Full subtitle customization — elevated from Comprehensive because our
  game is dialogue-heavy and subtitles are a primary channel"]
- [e.g., "One-hand mode for controller — we have hold inputs critical to combat"]

**Features explicitly out of scope**:
- [e.g., "Screen reader for in-game world (not menus) — requires engine work
  beyond current capacity. Documented in Known Intentional Limitations."]

## Visual Accessibility

> **Why this section comes first**: Visual impairments affect the largest
> proportion of players who use accessibility features. Color vision deficiency
> alone affects approximately 8% of men and 0.5% of women. Text legibility at
> TV viewing distance is frequently the single largest accessibility failure
> in shipped games. Document every visual feature before implementation begins,
> because retrofitting minimum text sizes or color decisions after assets are
> locked is expensive.

| Feature | Target Tier | Scope | Status | Implementation Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|--------|---------------------|
| Minimum text size — menu UI | Standard | All menu screens | Not Started | 24px minimum at 1080p. At 4K, scale proportionally. Reference: WCAG 2.1 SC 1.4.4 requires text resizable to 200% without loss of content. |
| Minimum text size — subtitles | Standard | All voiced/captioned content | Not Started | 32px minimum at 1080p. Players viewing on TV at 3m are the constraint. |
| Minimum text size — HUD | Standard | In-game HUD | Not Started | 20px minimum for critical information (health, ammo, objective). Non-critical HUD elements may be smaller. |
| Text contrast — UI text on backgrounds | Standard | All UI text | Not Started | Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for body text (WCAG AA). 3:1 for large text (18px+ or 14px bold). Test with automated contrast checker on final color values. |
| Text contrast — subtitles | Standard | Subtitle display | Not Started | Minimum 7:1 ratio (WCAG AAA) for subtitles — players read them quickly and cannot control background. Use drop shadow or opaque background box by default. |
| Colorblind mode — Protanopia | Standard | All color-coded gameplay | Not Started | Red-green — affects ~6% of men. Primary concern: health bars, enemy indicators, map markers. Shift red signals to orange/yellow; shift green signals to teal. |
| Colorblind mode — Deuteranopia | Standard | All color-coded gameplay | Not Started | Green-red — affects ~1% of men. Similar to Protanopia in practical impact. Often the same palette adjustment covers both. Verify with Coblis or Colour Blindness Simulator. |
| Colorblind mode — Tritanopia | Standard | All color-coded gameplay | Not Started | Blue-yellow — rarer (~0.001%). Shift blue UI elements to purple; shift yellow to orange. |
| Color-as-only-indicator audit | Basic | All UI and gameplay | Not Started | List every place color is the SOLE differentiator in the table below. Each must have a non-color backup (icon, shape, pattern, text label) before shipping. |
| UI scaling | Standard | All UI elements | Not Started | Range: 75% to 150%. Default: 100%. Scaling must not break layout — test all screens at min and max. HUD scaling should be independent from menu scaling. |
| High contrast mode | Comprehensive | Menus (minimum); HUD (preferred) | Not Started | Replace all semi-transparent backgrounds with fully opaque. Replace mid-tone UI colors with black/white/system-high-contrast colors. All interactive elements outlined. |
| Brightness/gamma controls | Basic | Global | Not Started | Exposed in graphics settings. Include a reference calibration image (a gradient or symbol barely visible at correct calibration). Range: -50% to +50% from default. |
| Screen flash / strobe warning | Basic | All cutscenes, VFX | Not Started | (1) Pre-launch warning screen with photosensitivity seizure notice. (2) Audit all flash-heavy VFX against Harding FPA standard (no more than 3 flashes per second above luminance threshold). (3) Optional: flash reduction mode that lowers flash amplitude by 80%. |
| Motion/animation reduction mode | Standard | All UI transitions, camera shake, VFX | Not Started | Reduce or eliminate: screen shake, camera bob, motion blur, parallax scrolling in menus, looping background animations. Cannot fully eliminate: player movement animation (would break readability). Toggle in accessibility settings. |
| Subtitles — on/off | Basic | All voiced content | Not Started | Default: OFF (industry standard — many players prefer immersion). Prominently offered at first launch. |
| Subtitles — speaker identification | Standard | All voiced content | Not Started | Speaker name displayed before dialogue line. Color-coded by speaker IF colors differ by more than hue alone (test for colorblind compatibility). |
| Subtitles — style customization | Comprehensive | Subtitle display | Not Started | Font size (4 sizes minimum), background opacity (0–100%), text color (white / yellow / custom), position (bottom / top / player-relative). |
| Subtitles — sound effect captions | Comprehensive | Gameplay-critical SFX | Not Started | See Auditory Accessibility section for which SFX qualify. Format: [SOUND DESCRIPTION] in brackets, distinct from dialogue. |

### Color-as-Only-Indicator Audit

> Fill in every gameplay or UI element where color is currently the sole
> differentiator. Resolve each before shipping. A resolved entry has a non-color
> backup that works in all three colorblind modes above.

| Location | Color Signal | What It Communicates | Non-Color Backup | Status |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------|
| [Health bar] | [Red = low health] | [Player is near death] | [Bar also shows numeric value and flashes] | [Not Started] |
| [Minimap markers] | [Red = enemy, green = ally] | [Unit allegiance] | [Enemy markers are triangles; ally markers are circles] | [Not Started] |
| [Inventory item rarity] | [Color-coded border (grey/blue/purple/gold)] | [Item quality tier] | [Rarity name shown on hover/focus; icon star count] | [Not Started] |
| [Add row for each color-coded element] | | | | |

## Motor Accessibility

> **Why motor accessibility matters for games**: Games are more motor-demanding
> than most software. A web form requires precise clicks; a game may require
> rapid simultaneous button combinations held for specific durations. Motor
> impairments span a wide range — from tremor (affecting precision) to
> hemiplegia (one functional hand) to RSI (affecting hold duration). The AbleGamers
> Able Assistance program estimates 35 million gamers in the US have a disability
> affecting their ability to play. Many of the features below cost very little
> to implement if planned from the start, and are extremely expensive to add post-launch.

| Feature | Target Tier | Scope | Status | Implementation Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|--------|---------------------|
| Full input remapping | Standard | All gameplay inputs, all platforms | Not Started | Every input bound by default must be rebindable. Remapping applies to keyboard, mouse, controller, and any supported peripheral independently. No two actions may be bound to the same input simultaneously (warn on conflict). Persist remapping to player profile. |
| Input method switching | Standard | PC | Not Started | Player must be able to switch between keyboard/mouse and gamepad at any moment without restarting. UI must update prompts dynamically (show correct button icons for active input method). |
| One-hand mode | [Tier] | [Identify which features require two simultaneous hands] | Not Started | Audit every multi-input action. For each: can it be executed with a single hand? If not, provide a toggle alternative or hold-to-toggle version. Specify here which features have a one-hand path and which do not. |
| Hold-to-press alternatives | Standard | All hold inputs | Not Started | Every "hold [button] to [action]" must offer a toggle alternative. Toggle mode: first press activates, second press deactivates. Example: "Hold to sprint" becomes optional "toggle sprint" mode. List all hold inputs in the game here. |
| Rapid input alternatives | Standard | Any button mashing / rapid input sequences | Not Started | Any input requiring more than 3 presses per second sustained must offer a single-press toggle alternative. Example: Hades' "Hold to dash repeatedly" solves this elegantly. |
| Input timing adjustments | Standard | QTEs, timed button presses, rhythm inputs | Not Started | Provide a timing window multiplier in accessibility settings. Minimum range: 0.5x to 3.0x. Default: 1.0x. At 3.0x, a 500ms window becomes 1500ms. Document every timed input in this game and test at all multiplier values. |
| Aim assist | Standard | All ranged combat / targeting | Not Started | Not just on/off — provide granularity: Assist Strength (0–100%), Assist Radius, Aim Magnetism (snap-to-target), and Aim Slowdown (near-target deceleration) as separate sliders. Default values should be tuned to feel helpful, not intrusive. |
| Auto-sprint / movement assists | Standard | Movement systems | Not Started | "Hold to sprint" toggle (covered above). Additionally: auto-run option (hold direction, player continues without input). Specify any movement input that is held continuously in normal gameplay. |
| Platforming / traversal assists | [Tier] | [If game has platforming] | Not Started | Evaluate whether auto-grab (generous ledge detection), coyote time extension, and jump height adjustment are appropriate for this game's design. If platforming is not a game system, mark N/A. |
| HUD element repositioning | Comprehensive | All HUD elements | Not Started | Allow players to move health bars, minimaps, and quest trackers to their preferred screen position. Particularly important for players using head-tracking or eye-gaze hardware who may have reduced peripheral vision coverage. |

## Cognitive Accessibility

> **Why cognitive accessibility is often under-specced**: Cognitive accessibility
> affects players with ADHD, dyslexia, autism spectrum conditions, acquired brain
> injuries, and anxiety disorders — a larger combined population than many studios
> realize. It also benefits all players in high-stress moments. The most common
> failures are: no pause anywhere, tutorial information that can only be seen once,
> and systems that require tracking too many simultaneous states. Games like
> Hades and Celeste have demonstrated that cognitive assist options (god mode,
> persistent reminders, extended text display) do not harm the experience for
> players who don't use them.

| Feature | Target Tier | Scope | Status | Implementation Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|--------|---------------------|
| Difficulty options | Standard | All gameplay difficulty parameters | Not Started | Separate granular sliders where possible (damage dealt, damage received, enemy aggression, enemy speed) rather than a single Easy/Normal/Hard label. Document which parameters are adjustable and which are fixed. Fixed parameters require a design justification. |
| Pause anywhere | Basic | All gameplay states | Not Started | Players must be able to pause during any gameplay state, including cutscenes, dialogue, and tutorial sequences. Document any state where pausing is currently prevented and the design justification for that restriction. Any restriction is a risk. |
| Tutorial persistence | Standard | All tutorials and help text | Not Started | After dismissing a tutorial prompt, the player must be able to retrieve it from a Help section in the menu. Do not rely on players absorbing tutorials on first encounter — AbleGamers research shows many players dismiss prompts on reflex. |
| Quest / objective clarity | Standard | Quest and objective systems | Not Started | The current active objective must be accessible within 2 button presses at all times during gameplay. Display the full objective text on demand, not just a truncated marker. Avoid objectives that require inference ("investigate the northern region" — where exactly?). |
| Visual indicators for audio-only information | Standard | All SFX that carry gameplay information | Not Started | Audit every sound effect that communicates gameplay-critical state. For each: is there a visual equivalent? Directional audio (off-screen enemy) needs a screen-edge indicator. Critical warnings (boss phase transition, trap trigger) need visual cues. See Auditory Accessibility for full list. |
| Reading time for UI | Standard | All auto-dismissing dialogs | Not Started | No dialog, notification, or tooltip that contains actionable information may auto-dismiss in less than 5 seconds. Preferred: do not auto-dismiss at all — require player confirmation. Document every auto-dismissing element here and its current duration. |
| Cognitive load documentation | Comprehensive | Per game system | Not Started | For each system in systems-index.md, document the maximum number of things it asks the player to simultaneously track. Flag any system where the number exceeds 4. This is not a hard rule but a review trigger — high cognitive load systems need compensating UI clarity. See Per-Feature Accessibility Matrix below. |
| Navigation assists | Standard | World navigation | Not Started | Fast travel (to previously visited locations), waypoint system for current objective, optional objective indicator always visible. Document which of these apply to this game's design and which are intentionally omitted. |

---

## Auditory Accessibility

> **Why auditory accessibility matters even for players without hearing loss**:
> 7% of players are deaf or hard of hearing. Additionally, a large portion of
> players regularly play in environments where audio is reduced or absent (commute,
> shared household, infant sleeping). Any gameplay-critical information delivered
> only through audio is a design failure even before accessibility is considered.
> The guiding principle: every sound that changes what the player should DO next
> must have a visual equivalent.

| Feature | Target Tier | Scope | Status | Implementation Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|--------|---------------------|
| Subtitles for all spoken dialogue | Basic | All voiced content | Not Started | 100% coverage — no exceptions. Include narration, in-engine dialogue, radio/environmental dialogue heard from a distance. Test subtitle sync against voice acting timing. |
| Closed captions for gameplay-critical SFX | Comprehensive | Identified SFX list (below) | Not Started | Not all SFX need captions — only those that communicate state the player cannot infer visually. See the SFX audit table below. |
| Mono audio option | Comprehensive | Global audio output | Not Started | Folds stereo/spatial audio to mono. Preserves volume balance between channels rather than summing to full volume on both sides. Essential for players with single-sided deafness. |
| Independent volume controls | Basic | Music / SFX / Voice / UI audio buses | Not Started | Four independent sliders minimum. Persist to player profile. Range: 0–100%, default 80%. Expose in both main settings and the pause menu. |
| Visual representations for directional audio | Comprehensive | All off-screen threats and audio events | Not Started | Screen-edge indicator pointing toward the audio source. Opacity scales with audio volume (closer = more opaque). Two variants: threat indicators (red) and information indicators (neutral). Example: The Last of Us Part II uses screen-edge indicators for off-screen enemy positions. |
| Hearing aid compatibility mode | Standard | High-frequency audio cues | Not Started | Audit all audio cues for frequency range. Any cue that communicates critical information only through high-frequency sound (above 4kHz) must have a low-frequency or visual equivalent. Hearing aids often filter high frequencies. |

### Gameplay-Critical SFX Audit

> Identify every sound effect that communicates state the player needs to act on.
> Each entry in this table requires either a confirmed visual backup or a caption.

| Sound Effect | What It Communicates | Visual Backup | Caption Required | Status |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| [Enemy attack windup sound] | [Incoming damage — player should dodge] | [Enemy animation telegraph visible from all camera angles] | [No — visual is sufficient] | [Not Started] |
| [Trap trigger click] | [Trap is about to fire] | [Not always visible depending on camera angle] | [Yes — "[CLICK]" caption with directional indicator] | [Not Started] |
| [Low health heartbeat] | [Player health critical] | [Health bar also shows critical state visually] | [No — visual is sufficient] | [Not Started] |
| [Quest completion chime] | [Objective completed] | [Quest tracker updates visually] | [No — visual is sufficient] | [Not Started] |
| [Add each SFX that changes what the player should do] | | | | |

## Platform Accessibility API Integration

> **Why this section exists**: Each platform provides native accessibility APIs
> that, when used, allow OS-level features (system screen readers, display
> accommodations, motor accessibility services) to work with your game. Ignoring
> these APIs does not break the game, but it means players who rely on OS-level
> accessibility tools get no benefit from them inside your game. Xbox in particular
> requires XAG compliance for certification. Verify platform requirements before
> committing to a tier — platform requirements set a floor, not a ceiling.

| Platform | API / Standard | Features Planned | Status | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| Xbox (GDK) | Xbox Game Core Accessibility / XAG | [Input remapping via Xbox Ease of Access, high contrast support, narrator integration for menus] | Not Started | XAG compliance is required for ID@Xbox Game Pass consideration. Review XAG checklist at https://docs.microsoft.com/gaming/accessibility/guidelines |
| PlayStation 5 | Sony Accessibility Guidelines / AccessibilityNode API | [Screen reader passthrough for menus, mono audio, high contrast] | Not Started | PS5 natively supports system-level audio description and mono audio if the game exposes AccessibilityNode data on UI elements. |
| Steam (PC) | Steam Accessibility Features / SDL | [Controller input remapping via Steam Input, subtitle support] | Not Started | Steam Input allows system-level remapping independent of in-game remapping. In-game remapping still required for keyboard/mouse. |
| iOS | UIAccessibility / VoiceOver | [VoiceOver support for menus if mobile port planned] | N/A | Only required if mobile release is in scope. |
| Android | AccessibilityService / TalkBack | [TalkBack support for menus if mobile port planned] | N/A | Only required if mobile release is in scope. |
| PC (Screen Reader) | JAWS / NVDA / Windows Narrator | [Menu navigation announcements] | Not Started | Requires UI elements to expose accessible names and roles via platform UI layer. Godot 4.5+ AccessKit integration covers this for supported control types. Verify against engine-reference/godot/ docs. |

## Per-Feature Accessibility Matrix

> **Why this matrix exists**: Accessibility is not a list of settings — it is a
> property of every game system. This matrix creates the "accessibility impact"
> view of the game: which systems have which barriers, and whether those barriers
> are addressed. When a new system is added to systems-index.md, a row must be
> added here. If a system has an unaddressed accessibility concern, it cannot be
> marked Approved in the systems index.

| System | Visual Concerns | Motor Concerns | Cognitive Concerns | Auditory Concerns | Addressed | Notes |
|--------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------|-------|
| [Combat System] | [Enemy health bars are color-coded; attack animations may cause motion sickness] | [Rapid input required for combos; hold inputs for guard] | [Track enemy patterns + cooldowns + player resources simultaneously] | [Audio cues for off-screen attacks; critical damage warning sounds] | [Partial] | [Colorblind palette applied; hold-to-block toggle needed] |
| [Inventory / Equipment] | [Item rarity conveyed by border color] | [No motor concerns — turn-based] | [Item stats comparison requires reading multiple values] | [None — no critical audio in this system] | [Partial] | [Non-color rarity indicators in progress] |
| [Dialogue System] | [Subtitle display depends on contrast settings] | [No motor concerns] | [Long dialogue trees with time pressure on dialogue choices] | [All dialogue must be subtitled] | [Not Started] | [Timed dialogue choices must support extended timer option] |
| [Navigation / World Map] | [Map marker colors] | [No motor concerns] | [Quest objective clarity; waypoint visibility] | [Audio pings for objectives have no visual equivalent] | [Not Started] | |
| [Add system from systems-index.md] | | | | | | |

## Accessibility Test Plan

> **Why testing accessibility separately from QA**: Standard QA tests whether
> features work. Accessibility testing tests whether features work for players
> who use them. These are different tests. A subtitle system can pass QA (it
> displays text) and fail accessibility testing (the text is unreadable at TV
> distance by a player with low vision). Plan for three test types: automated
> (contrast ratios, text sizes), manual internal (team members simulating
> impairments using accessibility simulators), and user testing (players who
> actually use these features).

| Feature | Test Method | Test Cases | Pass Criteria | Responsible | Status |
|---------|------------|------------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| Text contrast ratios | Automated — contrast analyzer tool on all UI screenshots | All text/background combinations at all game states | All body text ≥ 4.5:1; all large text ≥ 3:1; subtitle backgrounds ≥ 7:1 | ux-designer | Not Started |
| Colorblind modes | Manual — Coblis simulator on all game screenshots with modes enabled | Gameplay screenshots in exploration, combat, inventory in each mode | No essential information is lost in any mode; player can complete all objectives without color discrimination | ux-designer | Not Started |
| Input remapping | Manual — remap all inputs to non-default bindings, complete tutorial and first level | All default inputs rebound; gameplay functions correctly; no binding conflict possible | All actions accessible after remapping; conflict prevention works; bindings persist across restart | qa-tester | Not Started |
| Subtitle accuracy | Manual — verify against voice script, check all lines | All voiced content; subtitle timing; speaker identification | 100% of voiced lines subtitled; speaker identified for all multi-character scenes; no subtitle display for more than 3 seconds after line ends | qa-tester | Not Started |
| Hold input toggles | Manual — enable all toggle alternatives, complete all combat and traversal sequences | All hold inputs in toggle mode | All hold actions completable in toggle mode; no gameplay state requires sustained hold when toggle is enabled | qa-tester | Not Started |
| Reduced motion mode | Manual — enable mode, navigate all menus and complete first hour of gameplay | All menu transitions; all HUD animations; all camera shake events | No looping animations in menus; no camera shake above threshold; all screen transitions are cross-fade or cut | ux-designer | Not Started |
| Platform screen reader (menu) | Manual — enable OS screen reader, navigate all menus | Main menu, settings, pause menu, inventory, map | All interactive menu elements have screen reader announcements; navigation order is logical; no element unreachable by keyboard/D-pad | ux-designer | Not Started |
| User testing — colorblind | User testing with colorblind participants | Full game session with each colorblind mode | Participants complete all content without requesting color clarification; no session-stopping confusion | producer | Not Started |
| User testing — motor impairment | User testing with participants using one hand or adaptive controllers | Full game session with toggle and extended timing modes enabled | Participants complete all MVP content within tolerance of able-bodied completion time | producer | Not Started |

## Known Intentional Limitations

> **Why document what is NOT included**: Omissions left undocumented become
> surprises at certification or in community feedback. Documenting a limitation
> with a rationale demonstrates that it was a deliberate choice, not an oversight.
> It also identifies which players are not served and what the mitigation is.
> Every entry here is a risk — assess it honestly.

| Feature | Tier Required | Why Not Included | Risk / Impact | Mitigation |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| [Screen reader support for in-game world (NPCs, objects, environmental text)] | Exemplary | Engine (Godot 4.6) AccessKit integration covers menus only; extending to the game world requires a custom spatial audio description system beyond current scope | Affects blind and low-vision players who can navigate menus but cannot independently explore the game world | Ensure all critical world information is duplicated in accessible menu systems (quest log, map); evaluate for post-launch DLC |
| [Full subtitle customization (font/color/background)] | Comprehensive | Scope reduction — targeting Standard tier. Custom font rendering in Godot requires additional asset pipeline work | Affects deaf and hard-of-hearing players with specific legibility needs; particularly affects players with dyslexia who use custom fonts | Provide two preset subtitle styles (default and high-readability) as a partial mitigation; log for post-launch update |
| [Tactile/haptic alternatives for all audio cues] | Exemplary | Platform rumble API integration for non-Xbox platforms is out of scope for v1.0 | Affects deaf players relying on haptic feedback; PC players with non-Xbox controllers get no haptic response | Xbox controller haptic integration is in scope; evaluate PlayStation DualSense haptic API for a post-launch patch |
| [Add any other intentionally excluded accessibility feature] | | | | |

---

## Audit History

> **Why track audit history**: Accessibility is not certified once and done.
> Platform requirements change. New features may introduce new barriers. Legal
> standards evolve. An audit history demonstrates due diligence and helps identify
> regressions between audits.

| Date | Auditor | Type | Scope | Findings Summary | Status |
|------|---------|------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| [Date] | [Internal — ux-designer] | Internal review | [Pre-submission checklist against committed tier] | [e.g., "12 items verified, 3 open issues: subtitle contrast below target in 2 scenes, color-only indicator on minimap not resolved"] | [In Progress] |
| [Date] | [External — AbleGamers Player Panel] | User testing | [Motor accessibility — one-hand mode and timing adjustments] | [e.g., "Toggle modes functional. Timed QTE window at 3x still failed for one participant — recommend 5x option."] | [Findings addressed] |
| [Add row for each audit] | | | | | |
