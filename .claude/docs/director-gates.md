# Director Gates — Shared Review Pattern

This document defines the standard gate prompts for all director and lead reviews
across every workflow stage. Skills reference gate IDs from this document instead
of embedding full prompts inline — eliminating drift when prompts need updating.

**Scope**: All 7 production stages (Concept → Release), all 3 Tier 1 directors,
all key Tier 2 leads. Any skill, team orchestrator, or workflow may invoke these gates.

---

## How to Use This Document

In any skill, replace an inline director prompt with a reference:

```
Spawn `creative-director` via Task using gate **CD-PILLARS** from
`.claude/docs/director-gates.md`.
```

Pass the context listed under that gate's **Context to pass** field, then handle
the verdict using the **Verdict handling** rules below.

---

## Review Modes

Review intensity controls whether director gates run. It can be set globally
(persists across sessions) or overridden per skill run.

**Global config**: `production/review-mode.txt` — one word: `full`, `lean`, or `solo`.
Set once during `/start`. Edit the file directly to change it at any time.

**Per-run override**: any gate-using skill accepts `--review [full|lean|solo]` as an
argument. This overrides the global config for that run only.

Examples:
```
/brainstorm space horror           → uses global mode
/brainstorm space horror --review full   → forces full mode this run
/architecture-decision --review solo     → skips all gates this run
```

| Mode | What runs | Best for |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `full` | All gates active — every workflow step reviewed | Teams, learning users, or when you want thorough director feedback at every step |
| `lean` | PHASE-GATEs only (`/gate-check`) — per-skill gates skipped | **Default** — solo devs and small teams; directors review at milestones only |
| `solo` | No director gates anywhere | Game jams, prototypes, maximum speed |

**Check pattern — apply before every gate spawn:**

```
Before spawning gate [GATE-ID]:
1. If skill was called with --review [mode], use that
2. Else read production/review-mode.txt
3. Else default to full

Apply the resolved mode:
- solo → skip all gates. Note: "[GATE-ID] skipped — Solo mode"
- lean → skip unless this is a PHASE-GATE (CD-PHASE-GATE, TD-PHASE-GATE, PR-PHASE-GATE)
         Note: "[GATE-ID] skipped — Lean mode"
- full → spawn as normal
```

---

## Invocation Pattern (copy into any skill)

**MANDATORY: Resolve review mode before every gate spawn.** Never spawn a gate without checking. The resolved mode is determined once per skill run:
1. If skill was called with `--review [mode]`, use that
2. Else read `production/review-mode.txt`
3. Else default to `lean`

Apply the resolved mode:
- `solo` → **skip all gates**. Note in output: `[GATE-ID] skipped — Solo mode`
- `lean` → **skip unless this is a PHASE-GATE** (CD-PHASE-GATE, TD-PHASE-GATE, PR-PHASE-GATE, AD-PHASE-GATE). Note: `[GATE-ID] skipped — Lean mode`
- `full` → spawn as normal

```
# Apply mode check, then:
Spawn `[agent-name]` via Task:
- Gate: [GATE-ID] (see .claude/docs/director-gates.md)
- Context: [fields listed under that gate]
- Await the verdict before proceeding.
```

For parallel spawning (multiple directors at the same gate point):

```
# Apply mode check for each gate first, then spawn all that survive:
Spawn all [N] agents simultaneously via Task — issue all Task calls before
waiting for any result. Collect all verdicts before proceeding.
```

---

## Standard Verdict Format

All gates return one of three verdicts. Skills must handle all three:

| Verdict | Meaning | Default action |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **APPROVE / READY** | No issues. Proceed. | Continue the workflow |
| **CONCERNS [list]** | Issues present but not blocking. | Surface to user via `AskUserQuestion` — options: `Revise flagged items` / `Accept and proceed` / `Discuss further` |
| **REJECT / NOT READY [blockers]** | Blocking issues. Do not proceed. | Surface blockers to user. Do not write files or advance stage until resolved. |

**Escalation rule**: When multiple directors are spawned in parallel, apply the
strictest verdict — one NOT READY overrides all READY verdicts.

---

## Recording Gate Outcomes

After a gate resolves, record the verdict in the relevant document's status header:

```markdown
> **[Director] Review ([GATE-ID])**: APPROVED [date] / CONCERNS (accepted) [date] / REVISED [date]
```

For phase gates, record in `docs/architecture/architecture.md` or
`production/session-state/active.md` as appropriate.

- Full pillar set with names, definitions, and design tests
- Anti-pillars list
- Core fantasy statement
- Unique hook ("Like X, AND ALSO Y")

**Prompt**:
> "Review these game pillars. Are they falsifiable — could a real design decision
> actually fail this pillar? Do they create meaningful tension with each other? Do
> they differentiate this game from its closest comparables? Would they help resolve
> a design disagreement in practice, or are they too vague to be useful? Return
> specific feedback for each pillar and an overall verdict: APPROVE (strong), CONCERNS
> [list] (needs sharpening), or REJECT (weak — pillars do not carry weight)."

**Verdicts**: APPROVE / CONCERNS / REJECT

**Prompt**:
> "Review this systems decomposition against the game's design pillars. Does the
> full set of MVP-tier systems collectively deliver the core fantasy? Are there
> systems whose mechanics don't serve any stated pillar — indicating they may be
> scope creep? Are there pillar-critical player experiences that have no system
> assigned to deliver them? Are any systems missing that the core loop requires?
> Return APPROVE (systems serve the vision), CONCERNS [specific gaps or
> misalignments with their pillar implications], or REJECT [fundamental gaps —

- Game pillars and core fantasy statement
- The specific hypothesis being tested

**Prompt**:
> "Review this playtest report against the game's design pillars and core fantasy.
> Is the player experience matching the intended fantasy? Are there systematic issues
> that represent pillar drift — mechanics that feel fine in isolation but undermine
> the intended experience? Return APPROVE (core fantasy is landing), CONCERNS [gaps
> between intended and actual experience], or REJECT [core fantasy is not present —
> redesign needed before further playtesting]."

- Layer assignments (Foundation / Core / Feature / Presentation / Polish)
- The full dependency graph (what each system depends on)
- Any bottleneck systems flagged (many dependents)
- Any circular dependencies found and their proposed resolutions

**Prompt**:
> "Review this systems decomposition from an architectural perspective before GDD
> authoring begins. Are the system boundaries clean — does each system own a
> distinct concern with minimal overlap? Are there God Object risks (systems doing
> too much)? Does the dependency ordering create implementation-sequencing problems?
> Are there implicit shared-state problems in the proposed boundaries that will
> cause tight coupling when implemented? Are any Foundation-layer systems actually
> dependent on Feature-layer systems (inverted dependency)? Return APPROVE
> (boundaries are architecturally sound — proceed to GDD authoring), CONCERNS

- Engine version and LLM knowledge cutoff (from `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/VERSION.md`)
- Relevant excerpt from breaking-changes or deprecated-apis docs

**Prompt**:
> "Review this engine API usage against the version reference. Is this API present

**Context to pass**:
- Full vision scope description
- MVP definition
- Timeline estimate
- Team size (solo / small team / etc.)
- Scope tiers (what ships if time runs out)

**Prompt**:
> "Review this scope estimate. Is the MVP achievable in the stated timeline for
> the stated team size? Are the scope tiers correctly ordered by risk — does each
> tier deliver a shippable product if work stops there? What is the most likely
> cut point under time pressure, and is it a graceful fallback or a broken product?
> Return REALISTIC (scope matches capacity), OPTIMISTIC [specific adjustments
> recommended], or UNREALISTIC [blockers — timeline or MVP must be revised]."

- Epic index path (`production/epics/index.md`)
- Milestone timeline and target dates
- Team capacity (solo / small team / size)
- Layer being epiced (Foundation / Core / Feature / etc.)

**Prompt**:
> "Review this epic structure for production feasibility before story breakdown
> begins. Are the epic boundaries scoped appropriately — could each epic realistically
> complete before a milestone deadline? Are epics correctly ordered by system
> dependency — does any epic require another epic's output before it can start?
> Are any epics underscoped (too small, should merge) or overscoped (too large,
> should split into 2-3 focused epics)? Are the Foundation-layer epics scoped to
> allow Core-layer epics to begin at the start of the next sprint after Foundation
> completes? Return REALISTIC (epic structure is producible), CONCERNS [specific

- Target platform (if known)
- Any reference games or visual touchstones mentioned by the user

**Prompt**:
> "Based on these game pillars and core concept, propose 2-3 distinct visual identity
> directions. For each direction provide: (1) a one-line visual rule that could guide
> all visual decisions (e.g., 'everything must move', 'beauty is in the decay'), (2)
> mood and atmosphere targets, (3) shape language (sharp/rounded/organic/geometric
> emphasis), (4) color philosophy (palette direction, what colors mean in this world).
> Be specific — avoid generic descriptions. One direction should directly serve the
> primary design pillar. Name each direction. Recommend which best serves the stated
> pillars and explain why."

**Verdicts**: CONCEPTS (multiple valid options — user selects) / STRONG (one direction clearly dominant) / CONCERNS (pillars don't provide enough direction to differentiate visual identity yet)

**Prompt**:
> "Review this art bible for completeness and internal consistency. Does the color
> system match the mood targets? Does the shape language follow from the visual
> identity statement? Are the asset standards achievable within the platform
> constraints? Does the character design direction give artists enough to work from
> without over-specifying? Are there contradictions between sections? Would an
> outsourcing team be able to produce assets from this document without additional
> briefing? Return APPROVE (art bible is production-ready), CONCERNS [specific
> sections needing clarification], or REJECT [fundamental inconsistencies that must
> be resolved before asset production begins]."

> direction perspective. Is the visual identity established and documented at the
> level this phase requires? Are the right visual artifacts in place? Would visual
> teams be able to begin their work without visual direction gaps that cause costly
> rework later? Are there visual decisions that are being deferred past their latest
> responsible moment? Return READY, CONCERNS [specific visual direction gaps that
> could cause production rework], or NOT READY [visual blockers that must exist
> before this phase can succeed — specify what artifact is missing and why it
> matters at this stage]."

**Context to pass**:
- Story file path
- Story type (Logic / Integration / Visual/Feel / UI / Config/Data)
- Acceptance criteria list (verbatim from the story)
- The GDD requirement (TR-ID and text) the story covers

**Prompt**:
> "Review this story's acceptance criteria for testability before it enters the
> sprint. Are all criteria specific enough that a developer would know unambiguously
> when they are done? For Logic-type stories: can every criterion be verified with
> an automated test? For Integration stories: is each criterion observable in a
> controlled test environment? Flag criteria that are too vague to implement
> against, and flag criteria that require a full game build to test (mark these
> DEFERRED, not BLOCKED). Return ADEQUATE (criteria are implementable as written),
> GAPS [specific criteria needing refinement], or INADEQUATE [criteria are too
> vague — story must be revised before sprint inclusion]."

**Verdicts**: ADEQUATE / GAPS / INADEQUATE

---

### QL-TEST-COVERAGE — QA Lead Test Coverage Review

**Prompt**:
> "Review the test coverage for these implementation stories. Are all Logic stories
> covered by passing unit tests? Are Integration stories covered by integration
> tests or documented playtests? Are the GDD acceptance criteria each mapped to at
> least one test? Are there untested edge cases from the GDD Edge Cases section?
> Return ADEQUATE (coverage meets standards), GAPS [specific missing tests], or

**Context to pass**:
- Document or content file path(s)
- Narrative bible or tone guide path (if exists)
- Relevant world-building rules
- Character or faction profiles affected

**Prompt**:
> "Review this narrative content for internal consistency and adherence to
> established world rules. Are character voices consistent with their established
> profiles? Does the lore contradict any established facts? Is the tone consistent
> with the game's narrative direction? Return APPROVE, CONCERNS [specific
> inconsistencies to fix], or REJECT [contradictions that break the narrative
> foundation]."

**Verdicts**: APPROVE / CONCERNS / REJECT

---

### AD-VISUAL — Art Director Visual Consistency Review

**Trigger**: After art direction decisions are made, when new asset types are
introduced, or when a tech art decision affects visual style

**Context to pass**:
- Art bible path (if exists at `design/art-bible.md`)
- The specific asset type, style decision, or visual direction being reviewed
- Reference images or style descriptions
- Platform and performance constraints

**Prompt**:
> "Review this visual direction decision for consistency with the established art
> style and production constraints. Does it match the art bible? Is it achievable
> within the platform's performance budget? Are there asset pipeline implications
> that create technical risk? Return APPROVE, CONCERNS [specific adjustments], or
> REJECT [style violation or production risk that must be resolved first]."

**Verdicts**: APPROVE / CONCERNS / REJECT

---

## Parallel Gate Protocol

When a workflow requires multiple directors at the same checkpoint (most common
at `/gate-check`), spawn all agents simultaneously:

```
Spawn in parallel (issue all Task calls before waiting for any result):
1. creative-director  → gate CD-PHASE-GATE
2. technical-director → gate TD-PHASE-GATE
3. producer           → gate PR-PHASE-GATE
4. art-director       → gate AD-PHASE-GATE

Collect all four verdicts, then apply escalation rules:
- Any NOT READY / REJECT → overall verdict minimum FAIL
- Any CONCERNS → overall verdict minimum CONCERNS
- All READY / APPROVE → eligible for PASS (still subject to artifact checks)
```

---

## Adding New Gates

When a new gate is needed for a new skill or workflow:

1. Assign a gate ID: `[DIRECTOR-PREFIX]-[DESCRIPTIVE-SLUG]`
   - Prefixes: `CD-` `TD-` `PR-` `LP-` `QL-` `ND-` `AD-`
   - Add new prefixes for new agents: `AudioDirector` → `AU-`, `UX` → `UX-`
2. Add the gate under the appropriate director section with all five fields:
   Trigger, Context to pass, Prompt, Verdicts, and any special handling notes
3. Reference it in skills by ID only — never copy the prompt text into the skill
