# Create Control Manifest

The Control Manifest is a flat, actionable rules sheet for programmers. It
answers "what do I do?" and "what must I never do?" — organized by architectural
layer, extracted from all Accepted ADRs, technical preferences, and engine
reference docs. Where ADRs explain *why*, the manifest tells you *what*.

**Output:** `docs/architecture/control-manifest.md`

**When to run:** After `/architecture-review` passes and ADRs are in Accepted
status. Re-run whenever new ADRs are accepted or existing ADRs are revised.

---

## 1. Load All Inputs

### ADRs
- Glob `docs/architecture/adr-*.md` and read every file
- Filter to only Accepted ADRs (Status: Accepted) — skip Proposed, Deprecated,
  Superseded
- Note the ADR number and title for every rule sourced

### Technical Preferences
- Read `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md`
- Extract: naming conventions, performance budgets, approved libraries/addons,
  forbidden patterns

### Engine Reference
- Read `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/VERSION.md` for engine + version
- Read `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/deprecated-apis.md` — these become
  forbidden API entries
- Read `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/current-best-practices.md` if it exists

Report: "Loaded [N] Accepted ADRs, engine: [name + version]."

---

## 2. Extract Rules from Each ADR

For each Accepted ADR, extract:

### Required Patterns (from "Implementation Guidelines" section)
- Every "must", "should", "required to", "always" statement
- Every specific pattern or approach mandated

### Forbidden Approaches (from "Alternatives Considered" sections)
- Every alternative that was explicitly rejected — *why* it was rejected becomes
  the rule ("never use X because Y")
- Any anti-patterns explicitly called out

### Performance Guardrails (from "Performance Implications" section)
- Budget constraints: "max N ms per frame for this system"
- Memory limits: "this system must not exceed N MB"

### Engine API Constraints (from "Engine Compatibility" section)
- Post-cutoff APIs that require verification
- Verified behaviours that differ from default LLM assumptions
- API fields or methods that behave differently in the pinned engine version

### Layer Classification
Classify each rule by the architectural layer of the system it governs:
- **Foundation**: Scene management, event architecture, save/load, engine init
- **Core**: Core gameplay loops, main player systems, physics/collision
- **Feature**: Secondary systems, secondary mechanics, AI
- **Presentation**: Rendering, audio, UI, VFX, shaders

If an ADR spans multiple layers, duplicate the rule into each relevant layer.

---

## 3. Add Global Rules

Combine rules that apply to all layers:

### From technical-preferences.md:
- Naming conventions (classes, variables, signals/events, files, constants)
- Performance budgets (target framerate, frame budget, draw call limits, memory ceiling)

### From deprecated-apis.md:
- All deprecated APIs → Forbidden API entries

### From current-best-practices.md (if available):
- Engine-recommended patterns → Required entries

### From technical-preferences.md forbidden patterns:
- Copy any "Forbidden Patterns" entries directly

---

## 4. Present Rules Summary Before Writing

Before writing the manifest, present a summary to the user:

```
## Control Manifest Preview
Engine: [name + version]
ADRs covered: [list ADR numbers]
Total rules extracted:
  - Foundation layer: [N] required, [M] forbidden, [P] guardrails
  - Core layer: [N] required, [M] forbidden, [P] guardrails
  - Feature layer: ...
  - Presentation layer: ...
  - Global: [N] naming conventions, [M] forbidden APIs, [P] approved libraries
```

Ask: "Does this look complete? Any rules to add or remove before I write the manifest?"

---

## 4b. Director Gate — Technical Review

**Review mode check** — apply before spawning TD-MANIFEST:
- `solo` → skip. Note: "TD-MANIFEST skipped — Solo mode." Proceed to Phase 5.
- `lean` → skip. Note: "TD-MANIFEST skipped — Lean mode." Proceed to Phase 5.
- `full` → spawn as normal.

Spawn `technical-director` via Task using gate **TD-MANIFEST** (`.claude/docs/director-gates.md`).

Pass: the Control Manifest Preview from Phase 4 (rule counts per layer, full extracted rule list), the list of ADRs covered, engine version, and any rules sourced from technical-preferences.md or engine reference docs.

The technical-director reviews whether:
- All mandatory ADR patterns are captured and accurately stated
- Forbidden approaches are complete and correctly attributed
- No rules were added that lack a source ADR or preference document
- Performance guardrails are consistent with the ADR constraints

Apply the verdict:
- **APPROVE** → proceed to Phase 5
- **CONCERNS** → surface via `AskUserQuestion` with options: `Revise flagged rules` / `Accept and proceed` / `Discuss further`
- **REJECT** → do not write the manifest; fix the flagged rules and re-present the summary

---

## 5. Write the Control Manifest

Ask: "May I write this to `docs/architecture/control-manifest.md`?"

Format:

```markdown
# Control Manifest

> **Engine**: [name + version]
> **Last Updated**: [date]
> **Manifest Version**: [date]
> **ADRs Covered**: [ADR-NNNN, ADR-MMMM, ...]
> **Status**: [Active — regenerate with `/create-control-manifest update` when ADRs change]

`Manifest Version` is the date this manifest was generated. Story files embed
this date when created. `/story-readiness` compares a story's embedded version
to this field to detect stories written against stale rules. Always matches
`Last Updated` — they are the same date, serving different consumers.

This manifest is a programmer's quick-reference extracted from all Accepted ADRs,
technical preferences, and engine reference docs. For the reasoning behind each
rule, see the referenced ADR.

## Foundation Layer Rules

*Applies to: scene management, event architecture, save/load, engine initialisation*

### Required Patterns
- **[rule]** — source: [ADR-NNNN]
- **[rule]** — source: [ADR-NNNN]

### Forbidden Approaches
- **Never [anti-pattern]** — [brief reason] — source: [ADR-NNNN]

### Performance Guardrails
- **[system]**: max [N]ms/frame — source: [ADR-NNNN]

## Global Rules (All Layers)

### Naming Conventions
| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Classes | [from technical-preferences] | [example] |
| Variables | [from technical-preferences] | [example] |
| Signals/Events | [from technical-preferences] | [example] |
| Files | [from technical-preferences] | [example] |

| Memory ceiling | [from technical-preferences] |

### Approved Libraries / Addons
- [library] — approved for [purpose]

### Forbidden APIs ([engine version])
These APIs are deprecated or unverified for [engine + version]:
- `[api name]` — deprecated since [version] / unverified post-cutoff
- Source: `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/deprecated-apis.md`

### Cross-Cutting Constraints
- [constraint that applies everywhere, regardless of layer]
```

## 6. Suggest Next Steps

After writing the manifest:

- If epics/stories don't exist yet: "Run `/create-epics layer: foundation` then `/create-stories [epic-slug]` — programmers
  can now use this manifest when writing story implementation notes."
- If this is a regeneration (manifest already existed): "Updated. Recommend
  notifying the team of changed rules — especially any new Forbidden entries."

---

## Collaborative Protocol

1. **Load silently** — read all inputs before presenting anything
2. **Show the summary first** — let the user see the scope before writing
3. **Ask before writing** — always confirm before creating or overwriting the manifest. On write: Verdict: **COMPLETE** — control manifest written. On decline: Verdict: **BLOCKED** — user declined write.
4. **Source every rule** — never add a rule that doesn't trace to an ADR, a
   technical preference, or an engine reference doc
5. **No interpretation** — extract rules as stated in ADRs; do not paraphrase
   in ways that change meaning
