# Dev Story

This skill bridges planning and code. It reads a story file in full, assembles
all the context a programmer needs, routes to the correct specialist agent, and
drives implementation to completion — including writing the test.

**The loop for every story:**
```
/qa-plan sprint           ← define test requirements before sprint begins
/story-readiness [path]   ← validate before starting
/dev-story [path]         ← implement it  (this skill)
/code-review [files]      ← review it
/story-done [path]        ← verify and close it
```

**After all sprint stories are done:** run `/team-qa sprint` to execute the full QA cycle and get a sign-off verdict before advancing the project stage.

**Output:** Source code + test file in the project's `src/` and `tests/` directories.

---

## Phase 1: Find the Story

**If a path is provided**: read that file directly.

**If no argument**: check `production/session-state/active.md` for the active
story. If found, confirm: "Continuing work on [story title] — is that correct?"
If not found, ask: "Which story are we implementing?" Glob
`production/epics/**/*.md` and list stories with Status: Ready.

---

## Phase 2: Load Full Context

**Before loading any context, verify required files exist.** Extract the ADR path from the story's `ADR Governing Implementation` field, then check:

| File | Path | If missing |
|------|------|------------|
| TR registry | `docs/architecture/tr-registry.yaml` | **STOP** — "TR registry not found. Run `/create-epics` to generate it." |
| Governing ADR | path from story's ADR field | **STOP** — "ADR file [path] not found. Run `/architecture-decision` to create it, or correct the filename in the story's ADR field." |
| Control manifest | `docs/architecture/control-manifest.md` | **WARN and continue** — "Control manifest not found — layer rules cannot be checked. Run `/create-control-manifest`." |

If the TR registry or governing ADR is missing, set the story status to **BLOCKED** in the session state and do not spawn any programmer agent.

Read all of the following simultaneously — these are independent reads. Do not start implementation until all context is loaded:

### The story file
Extract and hold:
- **Story title, ID, layer, type** (Logic / Integration / Visual/Feel / UI / Config/Data)
- **TR-ID** — the GDD requirement identifier
- **Governing ADR** reference
- **Manifest Version** embedded in story header
- **Acceptance Criteria** — every checkbox item, verbatim
- **Implementation Notes** — the ADR guidance section in the story
- **Out of Scope** boundaries
- **Test Evidence** — the required test file path
- **Dependencies** — what must be DONE before this story

### The TR registry
Read `docs/architecture/tr-registry.yaml`. Look up the story's TR-ID.
Read the current `requirement` text — this is the source of truth for what the
GDD requires now. Do not rely on any inline text in the story file (may be stale).

### The governing ADR
Read `docs/architecture/[adr-file].md`. Extract:
- The full Decision section
- The Implementation Guidelines section (this is what the programmer follows)
- The Engine Compatibility section (post-cutoff APIs, known risks)
- The ADR Dependencies section

### The control manifest
Read `docs/architecture/control-manifest.md`. Extract the rules for this story's layer:
- Required patterns
- Forbidden patterns
- Performance guardrails

Check: does the story's embedded Manifest Version match the current manifest header date?
If they differ, use `AskUserQuestion` before proceeding:
- Prompt: "Story was written against manifest v[story-date]. Current manifest is v[current-date]. New rules may apply. How do you want to proceed?"
- Options:
  - `[A] Update story manifest version and implement with current rules (Recommended)`
  - `[B] Implement with old rules — I accept the risk of non-compliance`
  - `[C] Stop here — I want to review the manifest diff first`

If [A]: edit the story file's `Manifest Version:` field to the current manifest date before spawning the programmer. Then read the manifest carefully for new rules.
If [B]: read the manifest carefully for new rules anyway, and note the version mismatch in the Phase 6 summary under "Deviations".
If [C]: stop. Do not spawn any agent. Let the user review and re-run `/dev-story`.

### Dependency validation

After extracting the **Dependencies** list from the story file, validate each:

1. Glob `production/epics/**/*.md` to find each dependency story file.
2. Read its `Status:` field.
3. If any dependency has Status other than `Complete` or `Done`:
   - Use `AskUserQuestion`:
     - Prompt: "Story '[current story]' depends on '[dependency title]' which is currently [status], not Complete. How do you want to proceed?"
     - Options:
       - `[A] Proceed anyway — I accept the dependency risk`
       - `[B] Stop — I'll complete the dependency first`
       - `[C] The dependency is done but status wasn't updated — mark it Complete and continue`
   - If [B]: set story status to **BLOCKED** in session state and stop. Do not spawn any programmer agent.
   - If [C]: ask "May I update [dependency path] Status to Complete?" before continuing.
   - If [A]: note in Phase 6 summary under "Deviations": "Implemented with incomplete dependency: [dependency title] — [status]."

If a dependency file cannot be found: warn "Dependency story not found: [path]. Verify the path or create the story file."

---

### Engine reference
Read `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md`:
- `Engine:` value — determines which programmer agents to use
- Naming conventions (class names, file names, signal/event names)
- Performance budgets (frame budget, memory ceiling)
- Forbidden patterns

---

## Phase 3: Route to the Right Programmer

Based on the story's **Layer**, **Type**, and **system name**, determine which
specialist to spawn via Task.

**Config/Data stories — skip agent spawning entirely:**
If the story's Type is `Config/Data`, no programmer agent or engine specialist is needed. Jump directly to Phase 4 (Config/Data note). The implementation is a data file edit — no routing table evaluation, no engine specialist.

### Primary agent routing table

| Story context | Primary agent |
|---|---|
| Foundation layer — any type | `engine-programmer` |
| Any layer — Type: UI | `ui-programmer` |
| Any layer — Type: Visual/Feel | `gameplay-programmer` (implements) |
| Core or Feature — gameplay mechanics | `gameplay-programmer` |
| Core or Feature — AI behaviour, pathfinding | `ai-programmer` |
| Core or Feature — networking, replication | `network-programmer` |
| Config/Data — no code | No agent needed (see Phase 4 Config note) |

### Engine specialist — always spawn as secondary for code stories

Read the `Engine Specialists` section of `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md`
to get the configured primary specialist. Spawn them alongside the primary agent
when the story involves engine-specific APIs, patterns, or the ADR has HIGH
engine risk.

| Engine | Specialist agents available |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Godot 4 | `godot-specialist`, `godot-gdscript-specialist`, `godot-shader-specialist` |
| Unity | `unity-specialist`, `unity-ui-specialist`, `unity-shader-specialist` |
| Unreal Engine | `unreal-specialist`, `ue-gas-specialist`, `ue-blueprint-specialist`, `ue-umg-specialist`, `ue-replication-specialist` |

**When engine risk is HIGH** (from the ADR or VERSION.md): always spawn the engine
specialist, even for non-engine-facing stories. High risk means the ADR records
assumptions about post-cutoff engine APIs that need expert verification.

---

## Phase 4: Implement

Spawn the chosen programmer agent(s) via Task with the full context package:

Provide the agent with:
1. The complete story file content
2. The current GDD requirement text (from TR registry)
3. The ADR Decision + Implementation Guidelines (verbatim — do not summarise)
4. The control manifest rules for this layer
5. The engine naming conventions and performance budgets
6. Any engine-specific notes from the ADR Engine Compatibility section
7. The test file path that must be created
8. Explicit instruction: **implement this story and write the test**

The agent should:
- Create or modify files in `src/` following the ADR guidelines
- Respect all Required and Forbidden patterns from the control manifest
- Stay within the story's Out of Scope boundaries (do not touch unrelated files)
- Write clean, doc-commented public APIs

### Config/Data stories (no agent needed)

For Type: Config/Data stories, no programmer agent is required. The implementation
is editing a data file. Read the story's acceptance criteria and make the specified
changes to the data file directly. Note which values were changed and what they
changed from/to.

### Visual/Feel stories

Spawn `gameplay-programmer` to implement the code/animation calls. Note that
Visual/Feel acceptance criteria cannot be auto-verified — the "does it feel right?"
check happens in `/story-done` via manual confirmation.

---

## Phase 5: Write the Test

For **Logic** and **Integration** stories, the test must be written as part of
this implementation — not deferred to later.

Remind the programmer agent:

> "The test file for this story is required at: `[path from Test Evidence section]`.
> The story cannot be closed via `/story-done` without it. Write the test
> alongside the implementation, not after."

Test requirements (from coding-standards.md):
- File name: `[system]_[feature]_test.[ext]`
- Function names: `test_[scenario]_[expected_outcome]`
- Each acceptance criterion must have at least one test function covering it
- No random seeds, no time-dependent assertions, no external I/O
- Test the formula bounds from the GDD Formulas section

For **Visual/Feel** and **UI** stories: no automated test. Remind the agent to
note in the implementation summary what manual evidence will be needed:
"Evidence doc required at `production/qa/evidence/[slug]-evidence.md`."

For **Config/Data** stories: no test file. A smoke check will serve as evidence.

---

## Phase 6: Collect and Summarise

After the programmer agent(s) complete, collect:

- Files created or modified (with paths)
- Test file created (path and number of test functions written)
- Any deviations from the story's Out of Scope boundary (flag these)
- Any questions or blockers the agent surfaced
- Any engine-specific risks the specialist flagged

Present a concise implementation summary:

```
## Implementation Complete: [Story Title]

**Files changed**:
- `src/[path]` — created / modified ([brief description])
- `tests/[path]` — test file ([N] test functions)

**Acceptance criteria covered**:
- [x] [criterion] — implemented in [file:function]
- [x] [criterion] — covered by test [test_name]
- [ ] [criterion] — DEFERRED: requires playtest (Visual/Feel)

**Deviations from scope**: [None] or [list files touched outside story boundary]
**Engine risks flagged**: [None] or [specialist finding]
**Blockers**: [None] or [describe]

Ready for: `/code-review [file1] [file2]` then `/story-done [story-path]`
```

---

## Phase 7: Update Session State

Silently append to `production/session-state/active.md`:

```
## Session Extract — /dev-story [date]
- Story: [story-path] — [story title]
- Files changed: [comma-separated list]
- Test written: [path, or "None — Visual/Feel/Config story"]
- Blockers: [None, or description]
- Next: /code-review [files] then /story-done [story-path]
```

Create `active.md` if it does not exist. Confirm: "Session state updated."

---

## Error Recovery Protocol

If any spawned agent (via Task) returns BLOCKED, errors, or cannot complete:

1. **Surface immediately**: Report "[AgentName]: BLOCKED — [reason]" to the user before continuing to dependent phases
2. **Assess dependencies**: Check whether the blocked agent's output is required by subsequent phases. If yes, do not proceed past that dependency point without user input.
3. **Offer options** via AskUserQuestion with choices:
   - Skip this agent and note the gap in the final report
   - Retry with narrower scope
   - Stop here and resolve the blocker first
4. **Always produce a partial report** — output whatever was completed. Never discard work because one agent blocked.

Common blockers:
- Input file missing (story not found, GDD absent) → redirect to the skill that creates it
- ADR status is Proposed → do not implement; run `/architecture-decision` first
- Scope too large → split into two stories via `/create-stories`
- Conflicting instructions between ADR and story → surface the conflict, do not guess
- Manifest version mismatch → show diff to user, ask whether to proceed with old rules or update story first

## Collaborative Protocol

- **File writes are delegated** — all source code, test files, and evidence docs are written by sub-agents spawned via Task. Each sub-agent enforces the "May I write to [path]?" protocol individually. This orchestrator does not write files directly.
- **Load before implementing** — do not start coding until all context is loaded
  (story, TR-ID, ADR, manifest, engine prefs). Incomplete context produces code
  that drifts from design.
- **The ADR is the law** — implementation must follow the ADR's Implementation
  Guidelines. If the guidelines conflict with what seems "better," flag it in the
  summary rather than silently deviating.
- **Stay in scope** — the Out of Scope section is a contract. If implementing
  the story requires touching an out-of-scope file, stop and surface it:
  "Implementing [criterion] requires modifying [file], which is out of scope.
  Shall I proceed or create a separate story?"
- **Test is not optional for Logic/Integration** — do not mark implementation
  complete without the test file existing
- **Visual/Feel criteria are deferred, not skipped** — mark them as DEFERRED
  in the summary; they will be manually verified in `/story-done`
- **Ask before large structural decisions** — if the story requires an
  architectural pattern not covered by the ADR, surface it before implementing:
  "The ADR doesn't specify how to handle [case]. My plan is [X]. Proceed?"

---

## Recommended Next Steps

- Run `/code-review [file1] [file2]` to review the implementation before closing the story
- Run `/story-done [story-path]` to verify acceptance criteria and mark the story complete
- After all sprint stories are done: run `/team-qa sprint` for the full QA cycle before advancing the project stage
