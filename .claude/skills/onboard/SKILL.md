## Phase 1: Load Project Context

Read CLAUDE.md for project overview and standards.

Read the relevant agent definition from `.claude/agents/` if a specific role is specified.

---

## Phase 2: Scan Relevant Area

- For programmers: scan `src/` for architecture, patterns, key files
- For designers: scan `design/` for existing design documents
- For narrative: scan `design/narrative/` for world-building and story docs
- For QA: scan `tests/` for existing test coverage
- For production: scan `production/` for current sprint and milestone

Read recent changes (git log if available) to understand current momentum.

## Phase 3: Generate Onboarding Document

### Key Directories
| Directory | Contents | Your Interaction |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|

### Key Files

## Current Sprint Context

## Key Dependencies
[What other roles/systems this role interacts with most]

## Common Pitfalls
[Things that trip up new contributors in this area]

## First Tasks

1. [Read these documents first]
2. [Review this code/content]
3. [Start with this small task]

```

---

## Phase 4: Save Document

Present the onboarding document to the user.

Ask: "May I write this to `production/onboarding/onboard-[role]-[date].md`?"

If yes, write the file, creating the directory if needed.

---

## Phase 5: Next Steps

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — onboarding document generated.

- Share the onboarding doc with the new contributor before their first session.
- Run `/sprint-status` to show the new contributor current progress.
- Run `/help` if the contributor needs guidance on what to work on next.
